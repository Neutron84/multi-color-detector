# Real-Time Multi-Color Detection using OpenCV

This project is a computer vision application built with Python and OpenCV that detects multiple colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, etc.) in real-time using a webcam.

## 🎯 Features
- **Real-time Detection:** Processes video frames instantly from the webcam.
- **Multi-Color Support:** Can detect multiple colors simultaneously using a dictionary mapping.
- **Noise Reduction:** Uses contours and area thresholds to ignore background noise and small objects.
- **Bounding Boxes:** Draws dynamic bounding boxes around detected objects with their respective color labels.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AbolfazlDargi/multi-color-detector.git
